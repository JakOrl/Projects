Weather App project I have worked on and now have finished. In this project I explored a lot of new concepts including utilising GUIs
Creating setup files that download libraries to allow the program to run. 
Pulling information, parsing it and displaying it from a API
-------------------------------------------------------
To use the WeatherApp:
Unzip folder, keep ALL of the files in the same folder.
Run the setup.py application
Ready to use!!
